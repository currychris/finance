# Career Project Website

See the rubric at [bit.ly/CareerWebsiteRubric](https://bit.ly/CareerWebsiteRubric) or in Google classroom See some [example projects here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m6nxpGgG-QvoGtSwoHubN9UZl6rLmrMo/view).

## Day 1 - Design Mock Layouts and Research
* Create at least 2 different page layouts for your career site. This can be on your planning document or here on `mockup.draw`.
* When you are creating your layouts make sure that each page has at least one image, and a paragraph of text.
* Your site should also have a table or list somewhere in the site.
* Think about how you will set up the navigation and where you will put an image carousel as well.
* What color scheme will you use. Sites like https://color.adobe.com or https://coolors.co can help when selecting colors that contrast well and look good.

## Day 2 - Setting Up Your Folders, Pages and Layouts 
* Create the folders needed to hold images and CSS stylesheet(s).
* Create and name all 4 html documents (`index.html` plus 3 more).
* Then start coding the layout for your page. At this point it may be helpful you use some lorem ipsum. Later the lorem ipsum should be replaced with the actual summaries from your research.
* This is the time to get your layout created so that later you can just type in the information about your career choice. Create the `<div>`s (containers, rows, cols, etc.), `<a>`nchor tags, carousels, `<img>`s, navigation bars and other HTML elements that will make up your site.
* Now is a good time to run your code through a validator like [https://validator.w3.org](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) to find and remove any errors.

## Day 3 - Adding Content to your Pages
* Finish coding the layouts and start adding the actual content from your research.
* Make sure to include citations on each page that tell where you got the information from. Use external links to the souce of information.
* Start adding the images that support your site as well. Make sure that every image has alt text!
* Don't forget to include citations and links to where you found your research information.
  
## Day 4 - More Coding Time (Style)
* Work on applying your chosen color scheme.
    * Don't forget to make sure it has enough contrast to be readable.
* Apply specific fonts that you want to use.
* Any other spacing, borders or text properties that make your site look good.

## Day 5 - Finalize the site
* Make sure that everything as complete as you can get it.
* Use the rubric to ensure that you have met all of the requirements.
* Double check that all of your navigation links work.
* **Check your grammar and spelling!**
* Clean up the code and add `<!-- comments -->` or whitespace where appropriate to make the code more readable and organized.
* Run your code through a validator like [https://validator.w3.org](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) to find and remove any errors.
